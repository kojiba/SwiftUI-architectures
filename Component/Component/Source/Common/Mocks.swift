        Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting 
        that tends to focus on a "combination of low-life and high tech"[1] featuring 
        advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence
        and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.[2]
        Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s,
        when writers like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jos√© Farmer 
        and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual
        revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction.

        Comics exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as Judge Dredd, 
        first published in 1977.[3] Released in 1984, William Gibson's influential debut novel 
        Neuromancer would help solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk 
        subculture and early hacker culture. Other influential cyberpunk writers included 
        Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the
        debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation later 
        popularizing the subgenre.

        Early films in the genre include Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner, one of several of 
        Philip K. Dick's works that have been adapted into films. The films Johnny Mnemonic (1995)
        [4] and New Rose Hotel (1998),[5][6] both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped 
        commercially and critically. The Matrix trilogy (1999-2003) were some of the most successful 
        cyberpunk films. More recent additions to this genre include Blade Runner 2049 (2017), a sequel
        to the original 1982 film, as well as Upgrade (2018), Alita: Battle Angel (2019) based on the 1990s 
        Japanese manga Battle Angel Alita, and the 2018 Netflix TV series Altered Carbon based on Richard K. 
        Morgan's 2002 novel of the same name.
